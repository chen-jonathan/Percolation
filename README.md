# Percolation

Developed a program that would implement the Monto Carlo simulation to estimate the percolation threshold of an n x n grid. Responsible for mapping a 2-dimensional array (to represent each site in the grid) to a 1-dimensional union find object. Utilized the weighted quick union algorithm provided by the course to store the "connections" between open sites.

Implemented methods to calculate the sample standard deviation, sample mean of percolation threshold, high endpoint and low endpoint of confidence interval

Back-end development in Java. Front-end development was provided by the course instructors.

Currently, this program deals with a backwash bug (due to the virtaul top and virtual bottom idea implemented)
